This ESP8266 code was created for a public Wi-Fi network security demonstration and is used in cybersecurity talks.

The code is designed to run on an ESP8266 microcontroller.

It creates an open access point (AP) and a web server that redirects all requests to an informational page, alerting users to the risks of connecting to public Wi-Fi networks without adequate protection.

No authentication is required and no data is collected. The goal is to educate users about the importance of security on public Wi-Fi networks.
